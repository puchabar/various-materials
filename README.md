# various-materials
This repository contains various materials that I use in my daily work as well as in my didactic activities.
List of resources:
1. [Examples of using simple linear regression with the `numpy` package](regresion_numpy.ipynb)
2. [Examples of using Variable-Order Fractional Calculus (VO-FC) operators for integration and differentiation of time series signals](fractional_operators.ipynb)

If you find the materials on this repo useful feel free to use them. If you feel that something is wrong with the posted materials, please leave a note in the issues section.
